				<h1>What I've learned</h1>
				<div class="post-content">
					<p>
						I finished the web development part of the
						<a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a> course this
						past week.

					<p>
						I can’t believe how much I learned in the last three months! I
						wanted to share the technical concepts I’ve learned as part of the
						web development program of the six month, full-time course I am
						taking with Lambda School. My objective is to provide a summary of
						everything I’ve learned with regards to web development in the past
						few months.
					</p>

					<p>
						We started the web development course by learning about user
						interface and covered significantly HTML and CSS. These are the
						building blocks for web development and so we spent a lot of time
						understanding how these work. We struggled through positioning HTML
						elements and learned about the magic that is the flexbox module for
						positioning elements. I studied the HTML layout of websites and the
						importance of writing semantic HTML. I got very good at taking a
						website design mockup and and translating that to a working, fully
						responsive website.
					</p>

					<p>
						I learned how the DOM works and how to manipulate elements to make a
						website interactive using Javascript. We spent quite a bit of time
						covering the fundamentals of the Javascript programming language. We
						covered the basics like arrays and functions (which are actually
						objects) but went much deeper into callback functions, lexical
						scope, and prototypal inheritance in Javascript. I’ve built so many
						small projects and covered an insane amount of topics in the last
						months. We learned a huge amount on what it takes to build modern
						web applications.
					</p>

					<p>
						After we covered how to manipulate the DOM using Javascript, we
						moved on to learn React. It is the most common way to build
						interactive web applications that is used in the industry today. And
						so, we spent an entire month learning the framework.
						<a href="http://reactjs.org">React</a> is a Javascript UI library
						built by a team at Facebook to help scale web applications that is
						built around the concept of components. Components are reusable
						elements that can be plugged anywhere in an application. A React
						component gets updated automatically whenever there is a change in
						its state.
					</p>
					<img
						class="react-logo"
						src="../img/react-redux.png"
						alt="react and redux logo"
					/>
					<p>
						This makes it easier to build interactive web applications. When
						there is a change in state, the React framework checks to see what
						changed from the old version of the DOM and takes care of updating
						the DOM when something changes. Components receive properties that
						are used to display information which make components so versatile.
						We learned about higher order components that is a pattern for
						re-using component logic. We covered client side routing with React
						router and adding dynamic routes. In short, we learned an incredible
						amount of stuff and covered new concepts for building modern web
						applications with React.
					</p>

					<p>
						One particular concept that was difficult for me to understand was
						managing state using <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>.
						Given the large-scale applications that can be built using React, it
						becomes increasingly complex to manage the state of all components.
						Redux provides a predictable state container for a web application
						and operates based on the immutability principle. It works by
						defining actions that dispatch an object describing the action
						change which, in turn, is captured by a reducer. Reducers are
						essentially a pure function that copies the current state’s value,
						makes a new state, and outputs the application’s new state that then
						gets rendered to the DOM. This is helpful when managing large-scale
						applications. I, personally, have not used it too much in my
						projects but it was an interesting topic to cover. It was an intense
						few weeks learning all of these concepts and building projects along
						the way to solidify our understanding.
					</p>
					<p>
						After learning React and Redux, we switched gears a bit and spent a
						month covering back-end development. It was mainly focused on
						building web APIs using
						<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and
						<a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> that connect with a SQL
						database to provide data for an application. We covered huge topics
						that were difficult to go in depth, but were enough to understand
						the key parts. We learned about the best practices for building
						RESTful APIs that are stateless and how HTTP requests work. We
						learned about setting up a database and the basics of SQL for
						manipulating data. The topics were vast in scope but I feel we
						learned the areas that will help us in building functional web
						applications and receive guidance on what topics to tackle next to
						deepen our grasp of these topics.
					</p>
					<img
						class="node-logo"
						src="../img/node-logo.png"
						alt="node js logo"
					/>
					<p>
						I learned about HTTP requests and how to persist authentication
						using web tokens as well as the high-level pros and cons of
						encryption vs hashing. The last week of backend development was
						focused on testing best practices like unit tests and test driven
						development. All of these concepts were covered to ensure that we
						can build robust, fully functional web applications. It has been an
						intense and incredibly fun three months full of learning and
						applying what we learned. With each week that passed, I was always
						impressed at how much I learned that week.
					</p>

					<p>
						The next step for me, which is different than the traditional Lambda
						School curriculum, is a part of the program called Labs in which we
						build a real project. The goal is to mimic a real software
						development job that you work with a team and a project manager and
						follow a timeline to deliver increments to an application that can
						be launched as a real business. After Labs I will move on to a
						computer science program that includes topics such as data
						structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming in Python,
						operating systems, and many more interesting topics. I’m very
						excited and completely amazed at how much I’ve learned in the last
						three months.
					</p>

					<p>
						The curriculum and process at Lambda School has been incredible. I
						have learned more in the last few months that I have in years of
						formal and self-taught education. I am excited for the future of
						this type of education.

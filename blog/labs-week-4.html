				<h1>Labs: Fourth Week - Presentation</h1>
				<div class="post-content">
					<p>
						Project: RateMyDIY<br />
						Date: December 7, 2018
					</p>
					<h2>Individual Accomplishments</h2>
					<p>
						This week was all about making the project look good. We had been
						focusing on functionality only throughout the previous weeks so
						there was a lot of work to do in making it look like a real project.
						I worked on adding a cover image that looks good to the homepage and
						a search bar. I also worked on adding a navigation bar that will be
						on top of all pages in the website and will serve as the main
						navigation tool throughout the website. I tried to make the design
						choices based on common patterns that Iâ€™ve observed on other
						websites. Our project is inspired by the website Pexels as the
						functionality is similar and we really liked the way that the Pexels
						UI is designed. We spent time researching libraries that have
						pre-built components that we can use for displaying the projects,
						makers, and reviewers and decided to go with Material UI because of
						their card components. These look pretty good out of the box and
						allow for decent customization in displaying necessary info. We
						built the cards using the Material UI cards.
					</p>

					<h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
					<p>
						I worked on improving the navigation of the website by adding a nav
						bar that would be added to all websites. The goal was to have all of
						the links accessible so that a user can easily navigate to all parts
						of the website. I felt this was a common way for websites to make
						navigation easier and wanted to follow this pattern. The navigation
						bar has a logo at the top left that takes the user back to the home
						page. It has a search bar component in the middle for quickly
						searching for a project. I had to re-work the search bar component a
						bit so that it worked on both the homepage and the nav bar. On the
						right side, the nav bar has a picture of the user if they are logged
						in that has a menu for all of the useful links. From there, the user
						can create a new project or view their settings.

					<h2>Milestones Reflections</h2>
					<p>
						This week we were able to make progress faster. It felt good to have
						changes reflected and start to take shape as a professional project.
						As the functionality is almost complete, we shifted focus completely
						and began dedicating significant time to making it look good. We
						also spent time researching libraries and tools that can help in
						making the website look more professional like Material UI. I did
						more pair programming this week with a team member and I really
						enjoyed the process. As you are building the UI without a specific
						mockup in mind, it is very helpful to be able to do it in a
						collaborative way and ask questions as you go along. I enjoyed
						working together with a team member and we were able to be
						productive throughout the week.

					<h2>Mock Interview</h2>
					<p>
						The code challenge for this week was to build a function that takes
						in an array of numbers and a sum value and returns a list of pairs
						that equal the sum value provided. I was able to get a rough working
						function pretty easily but it included duplicates in the returned
						list of pairs. I had to spent a lot of time and re-working my
						solution to get a function that only returns the list of pairs.

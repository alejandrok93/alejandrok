				<h1>Labs: Third Week - Feature Complete</h1>
				<div class="post-content">
					<p>
						Project: RateMyDIY<br />
						Date: November 30, 2018
					</p>
					<h2>Individual Accomplishments</h2>
					<p>
						This week the goal was to to build out all of the features for the
						RateMyDIY project. We had to get the application to a point where it
						was working properly and all the features were functional. This
						included being able to create a project, edit/delete a project, add
						a review, view all reviews, search for a project, etc. I worked on
						the search functionality this week and on the ability to view all
						projects for a particular user. I decided to focus on building the
						search functionality earlier in the week, as we could use that for
						building other features of the web application.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once I had the search functionality working, I used that
						infrastructure to work on some of the other features for the
						website. For example, when you clicked on a username, it would
						perform a search and return all the projects that are relevant to
						that username. Additionally, clicking on a Popular Reviewer’s
						username would return all the projects that the user has reviewed. I
						enjoyed working on these features as it really involved working on
						both the front and backend for every feature. I also worked with
						Reactstrap for adding a pop up (Modal) when a user was not logged in
						and performed a search. The pop up would encourage the user to log
						in but would let them proceed if they did not want to log in.
					</p>
					<h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
					<p>
						I chose to work on one of the key features of the website this week.
						I decided to work on the ability for a user to search for a project.
						The search functionality involved both front and backend work as I
						had to develop how the website would capture the search term and
						send it to the backend to be processed and return the relevant
						projects. We decided to use a library called Fuse.js for searching
						as this allowed for a more flexible search rather than simply
						retrieving data from a SQL database using the specific search term.
						I learned about tokenization search terms within an array, a
						threshold for specificity, and assigning relevance to keys for the
						library to return the results. I had a challenge as our data is
						stored in a SQL database and the Fuse.js library required an array
						of objects to search. My approach was to write a SQL statement that
						would join all the (very normalized) tables we have in the database
						to output an array of objects that the library can take in to
						provide relevant results. As the dataset grows, it might become
						inefficient to output everything from the database and we might opt
						for a more robust solution like Elastic search or Apache Solr.
					</p>
					<p>
						I followed an approach of making the search functionality use a GET
						request and including the query in the URL. I thought this made
						sense as it is more accessible for an API to retrieve relevant
						projects and makes the search results by accessing a URL on the
						frontend. Some downsides of this are that more complex search
						queries can become tedious to add in a URL and might be easier to
						provide an object with options for a search query.
					</p>

					<h2>Milestones Reflections</h2>
					<p>
						The goal for this week was to build all of the features for the web
						application. We had to connect all of the pieces we had been working
						on in previous weeks so that the features work properly. I thought
						this week was very productive and we moved along at a faster pace.
						We made some real progress in building out the features as the set
						up of the application was already done in previous weeks. The week
						required a lot of reading other team member’s code and asking
						questions to understand how a component was built so that I can
						bring it to what I was building. This week started to feel like a
						real development experience because we are working on already built
						pieces and getting them to a point that these can be functional. The
						experience can be both frustrating because sometimes it is harder to
						understand how a component works and great because you can make
						progress faster as the underlying pieces have already been built. I
						really took advantage of the collaborative tools we have this week.
						If I was working on a feature and needed to understand I would
						message a team member and jump in a zoom or we would start a
						liveshare to pair program. It really helped to be in constant
						communication and I think it helped us a lot this week.

					<h2>Mock Interview</h2>
					<p>
						This week we conducted a second mock interview with another student.
						We each had to solve a coding challenge and record our process as we
						are working through finding a solution. I had to solve a challenge
						to build a Depth First Search algorithm given a tree data structure
						with a recursive and an iterative solution. I don’t have much
						experience working with trees so I was nervous about this code
						challenge. I was surprised because I thought that the recursive
						solution was going to be more challenging than an iterative one.
						Yet, it ended up the complete opposite. The recursive solution came
						more naturally to me and trying to solve it with an iterative
						approach was harder.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am starting to feel better at solving these challenges. I want to
						continue practicing as I can feel myself getting better at these.

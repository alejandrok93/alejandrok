					<h2>Individual Accomplishments</h2>
					<p>
						This week I worked on polishing the website so that it looks more
						like a professional website. This involved making changes to the UX
						of some pages that we had not updated and having a more uniform
						styling throughout the website. I also worked on the sorting
						functionality in the search results page. It is a very different
						process to work on adding new functionality once the majority of the
						project is done as I have to figure out how to get it working with
						what is already there. Some functionalities that we designed can
						definitely be improved and the mindset changes from getting it to
						work and done to is this the best way to accomplish this. I started
						to see some flaws in what we developed as we were polishing it.
						Getting it to a point where it is working is one thing but having
						the website be robust and easy to update is a different challenge
						that I had not experienced before.
					</p>
					<h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
					<p>
						My focus this week on making small changes so that the website
						looked clean and worked as expected. I did not work on any major
						feature as we decided that we should make sure that what was already
						developed would work properly. This was more of a challenge than I
						expected because some of the features that we developed had bugs
						that were caused by the way the featured was developed. It would
						take more effort than expected to get it to working like a finished
						product. For example, the search tags that we added to the home page
						were intended so that a user can click on one of those and view
						projects in that category. However, the way I developed those was
						that it would leverage the existing search functionality and will
						return projects that match that search term. Because of this, it was
						not possible to update the search tags so that it only returned
						projects within that category. We had to either re-work how a
						feature worked or adapt what was built so that it matches our
						requirements.

					<h2>Milestones Reflections</h2>
					<p>
						The main goal this week to make the website look like a polished,
						professional project. This turned out to be much more difficult than
						I thought it would be. I had heard about the 90/90 rule that says
						that getting the project to 90% done takes 90% percent of the effort
						but that getting the remaining 10% done takes another 90% of the
						effort. We experienced this rule because some of the features we
						developed are working but making it work perfectly will take much
						more effort. We found a ton of things like this were the design
						choices we made while working on building the feature determined how
						difficult it would be to make changes in the future. I’m a bit
						nervous for the next sprint in which we will be asked to make a
						change order for our project. I think it’s a great experience to
						look at the design decisions of a feature with a different objective
						in mind than just getting it to work. The other part of getting a
						polished project was more fun. It involved making UX changes and
						achieving a more uniform design throughout the website. We defined a
						look and feel last week and so we needed to make changes this week
						so that the entire website followed this.

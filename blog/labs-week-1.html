				<h1>Labs: First Week - Start Up</h1>
				<div class="post-content">
					<p>
						Project: RateMyDIY<br />
						Date: November 9, 2018
					</p>

					<h2>Individual Accomplishments:</h2>
					<p>
						The project we were assigned to work on during Labs is a web
						application to upload and review DIY projects. The idea is that
						people who enjoy working on DIY projects can share them with a
						community and receive feedback on their projects as well as reviews.
						I worked on building the initial structure of the components for the
						applications.I started with the Landing Page components and created
						three subcomponents to hold the categories of projects: Featured
						Projects, Popular Makers, Popular Reviewers which are containers for
						displaying projects, makers, and reviewers. These were pretty
						similar and only had a few differences in styling and data
						displayed. I also worked on adding the Search Bar component, the
						layout of the search page, and added a simple navigation to access
						the pages of the project.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was challenging to work on the setting up the components without
						having a back-end to retrieve data once I was adding the redux
						actions and reducers. I only worked on front-end tasks this week as
						other team members were working on server tasks like authentication
						and setting up the routes and the server did not start on my machine
						because of environment issues. We also wasted a lot of time working
						on getting very specific tasks working like Auth0 authentication and
						setting up a MSSQL database locally that was not productive in
						helping us towards the Sprint objective.
					</p>

					<h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
					<p>
						I worked on the components for displaying the projects and users in
						the landing page. The page is divided into three sections: featured
						projects, popular makers, and popular reviewers. I decided to break
						the page into three subcomponents so that they can be independent
						and retrieve data. Each component can retrieve data from the server
						to display the latest/best details to the user. I liked this
						approach because it separates the page into individual pieces that
						can be worked on and function independently. For example, if a use
						case arises to display the popular makers in another part of the web
						application, it would be possible to plug in that component. To
						build the components, I had to refresh my knowledge of Redux to
						create the corresponding actions and reducers and connect it to the
						Redux store.
